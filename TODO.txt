Parser
- [ ] leading whitespace in blocks breaks parser, e.g. r"\n{}" can't be parsed

IR generator
- [x] ensure there's always a return

LLVM backend
- [ ] variables
- [ ] float math

Language as a whole
- [ ] cast
- [ ] function calls
- [ ] let without initializer, but with type, with checks that it gets initialized before use
- [ ] verify functions have a return on all paths, with a coherent type
