Parser
- [ ] remove support for untyped `let` (let's make value mandatory for the moment)
- [ ] leading whitespace in blocks breaks parser, e.g. r"\n{}" can't be parsed

LLVM backend
- [ ] rather than a hash map for the values, add an index to IR instructions and use an array
- [ ] function calls
- [ ] float math
- [ ] cast
- [ ] variables

Language as a whole
- [ ] let without initializer, but with type, with checks that it gets initialized before use
