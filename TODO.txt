Parser
- [ ] comments
- [ ] leading whitespace in blocks breaks parser, e.g. r"\n{}" can't be parsed

Semantic analysis
- [x] ensure we cannot assign to a function parameter
- [ ] store function in the module symbol table (see last test in semantic_analyzer.rs)
- [ ] keep track of mutable/immutable variables

IR generator
- [x] ensure there's always a return
- [ ] split Load into multiple instructions (param, variable)

LLVM backend
- [x] variables
- [ ] float math

Language as a whole
- [ ] cast
- [ ] function calls
- [ ] let without initializer, but with type, with checks that it gets initialized before use
- [ ] verify functions have a return on all paths, with a coherent type

Clean-ups
- [x] use _always_ either argument or parameter

Testing
- [ ] get rid of insta and split llvm tests
- [ ] semantic testing of linked object
