Language as a whole
- [ ] if
  - [ ] avoid generating in LLVM an empty basic block (the merge block)
- [ ] check variables, are they declared only in the first block? need more tests
- [ ] cast
- [ ] let without initializer, but with type, with checks that it gets initialized before use
- [ ] verify functions have a return on all paths, with a coherent type
- [ ] keep track of mutable/immutable variables
